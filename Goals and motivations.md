# Goals
Once lireta is done, we expect it to be able to create music based solelly on legible, user friendly, text-based files, like `.txt`, `.json` or `.py`.

The audio will very likelly be [mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural_sound) and will achieve pitch manipulation by simply speeding up or slowing down the playback speed of a given instrument.

The syntax should be straighforward and intuitive, but remain powerful enough to allow advanced users to achieve their goals.

The user will not have to know Python to use lireta, but by knowing it they will be able to extend functionalities at will.

# Motivations
Good audio trackers tend to be complicated to use or restricted by payment. This reduces the accessibility of such tools and limits the composer by creating a barrier on usability.

Traditional music sheet inspired softwares, on the other hand, tend to restrict the composer by not having enough features, locking them with a very small set of tools.

Aditionally, most composing softwares, be it a tracker or music sheet inspired, have file formats that aren't easilly editable without the software itself.

Thus, a user friendly, highly customizable text-based tracker-like system could potentially solve some of those issues. By keeping it open source and with a human readable file format, acquiring lireta, understanding it and its file structure, modifying and sharing compositions should be much easier than with other tools.
