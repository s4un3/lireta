each line have a starting keyword and the other parameters

a parameter can be a str, an AudioWave or another line

for example, ["seq", "A", "B", "C", ["gliss" "D", "E"]]

lines are "resolved" by replacing their value in the upper line or in the "root" by their corresponding value, by using the keyword they call

a line can be resolved to None, and this ends up making it "dissapear" of the parameters of the upper lines

for example, ["seq", "A", ["bpm", "120"]] -> ["seq", "A", None] -> ["seq", "A"]

for a "root" line to be valid, it must resolve to None or AudioWave.

None means the line does not produce a sound, and AudioWave is the sound when it does produce None

If a line resolves to str, it might be used as a keyword later

If an AudioWave cannot be in the place of a keyword

A block can be started at any point, so something like:
{
    {};
    {
        {};
        {
            {};
        }
        {}
    }
        { note A; };
    }
    {};
    {};
    {
        {};
    }
};
is valid, but exactly the same as
note A;

Please note that
{ # A
    {
        # 1
    }
    {
        # 2
    };
};
is different than
{ # B
    {
        # 1
    };
    {
        # 2
    };
}
because on "A", the second block is a parameter for the first block, while on "B", each block is independant
